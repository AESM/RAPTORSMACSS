RAPTORSMACSS
==========================================================================

**R**apid **A**daptive **P**ractical **T**ricked-**O**ut **R**ocket **S****M****A****C****S****S**, or RAPTORSMACSS, is a Sass (SCSS) boilerplate, loosely inspired by the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) architecture pattern.
The naming convention is [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/) based at its roots, but implemented in a way that the user can use whichever naming convention they prefer.
