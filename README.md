RAPTORSMACSS
==========================================================================

**R**apid **A**daptive **P**ractical **T**ricked-**O**ut **R**ocket **S****M****A****C****S****S**, or RAPTORSMACSS, is a highly modular and organized Sass (SCSS) boilerplate.  It is loosely inspired by the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) architecture pattern, with some layout liberties taken.
The Harry Roberts' style [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/) naming convention is only implemented at RAPTORSMACSS' roots, so the user can use whichever naming convention they prefer.

## Riding the Raptor

**_NOTE:_** The commands below assume that you went with one of the two recommended [installation](#installation) strategies suggested above, and have the necessary [requirements](#requirements).

### Sass Watch
Before making any modifications to the SCSS files, change to the root directory of your project, and run one of the following commands...

- To compile minified CSS:

``` sh
sass --watch source/scss/raptor.scss:public/assets/stylesheets/raptor.min.css --style compressed
```

- To compile standard CSS:

``` sh
sass --watch source/scss/raptor.scss:public/assets/stylesheets/raptor.css
```

### Gulp Watch
For [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) enthusiasts, an optional `gulpfile.js` file has been included.  This file should be in the root directory of your project.
Before making any modifications to the SCSS or JavaScript files, change to any directory in your project (preferably the root), and run the following command...

- To have Gulp compile minified CSS and JavaScripts, standard CSS and JavaScripts, minified CSS sourcemaps, and standard CSS and JavaScript sourcemaps:

``` sh
gulp
```
